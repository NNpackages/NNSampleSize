# R Markdown

# This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->
# When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
## Embedding an R code chunk: 
#
#       ```{r marginalPowerCode, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} -->
#             NNSampleSize::pwr(end_type = "diff", n = sampleSize, sig.level = 0.05, trt = 0.5, ctrl = 1.5, 
#                               sd = 1, alternative = "two.sided", determine = "power") 
#       ``` 

## Including a table -->
#       ```{r sampleSizeTable, tab.cap = "Programming output of estimated sample size.", echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE}
#             tblSampleSize <- flextable::flextable(dplyr::rename(sampleSize, all_of(sampleSizeNames)))
#             tblSampleSize <- flextable::add_footer_lines(tblSampleSize, paste("Delta: ??. The method                         used was:", ssMethod, "."))
#             tblSampleSize <- flextable::font(tblSampleSize, part = "all", fontname = "Times New Roman (Body)")
#             tblSampleSize <- flextable::fontsize(tblSampleSize, part = "all", size = 12) # font size                         12
#             tblSampleSize <- flextable::bold(tblSampleSize, part = "header")
#             tblSampleSize <- flextable::italic(tblSampleSize, part = "footer")
#             flextable::set_table_properties(tblSampleSize, width = 1, layout = "autofit")
#        ``` 

## Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. 

# The output type bookdown ensures that cross-referencing within the document is possible.
# When manually knitting and generating a word document use the option "Knit to word_document2"
